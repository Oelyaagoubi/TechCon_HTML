            <p>TechCon began in 1987 as a modest gathering of 200 technology enthusiasts in Silicon Valley. Its founders, a group of engineers, envisioned a space where emerging technologies, particularly microcomputers, could be discussed and developed. The inaugural event, though small, marked the beginning of what would become a major global technology conference.</p>
